I chose to build a webpage that lets you drag and sort squares within a given area using React and Claude Web.

The micro iteration process wasn't bad and makes you feel involved in the development process. It makes it easier to catch bugs when you iterate the build process in this way.

Self-review ended up catching a few errors as well as some opportunities to optimize the build. For instance: Claude noticed a that it defined something static in a component and asked if I'd like to move that code to the top-level of the build, which was something I hadn't really thought about. It refered to this as "module-level constant simplification."

Something I like about Claude Web was that I didn't need to install it on my machine to use it.

It did end up catching a majority of the bugs when I asked it to check itself, but I remembered a time where I caught something it didn't, so I started asking it to check if there were more bugs after the first check for bugs. This yielded results once.

I think Claude Code CLI is faster when it comes to building, but again, the web-based version doesn't need to be downloaded. I think they both have their merits, but I might prefer using the CLI version over the browser version.

I think I would use this micro-iteration mostly when I'm building something I'm unfamiliar with, but I don't think it would be terrible to use it all the time.
